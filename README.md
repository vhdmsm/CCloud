## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Android Studio Ladybug or later
- Android SDK API 36 (Android 16)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/code3-dev/CCloud.git
   ```

2. Open the project in Android Studio

3. Build and run the project

### Building

To build the debug APK:
```bash
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

To build the release APK:
```bash
./gradlew assembleRelease
```

### OpenSubtitles API Key

Downloading English subtitles from OpenSubtitles needs an API key. Without one the app builds and works normally; only the online subtitle search is hidden.

1. Create a free account on [opensubtitles.com](https://www.opensubtitles.com) and create an API consumer on the [API consumers page](https://www.opensubtitles.com/en/consumers) to get a key.
2. For local builds, create `secrets.properties` in the project root (it is ignored by git):
   ```properties
   OPENSUBTITLES_API_KEY=your_api_key
   ```
3. For release builds with GitHub Actions, add a repository secret named `OPENSUBTITLES_API_KEY` (Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions). The build workflow writes it to `secrets.properties`.

No user login is needed: without one, OpenSubtitles allows a few downloads per day for each user's IP address.

### TMDB API Key

The **Popular (Web + Cast)** movie filter reads popularity and cast data from [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org). Without a key the app works normally; only that filter is hidden.

1. Create a free account on [themoviedb.org](https://www.themoviedb.org) and request an API key on the [API settings page](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api). Either the API key or the API read access token works.
2. For local builds, add it to `secrets.properties` in the project root:
   ```properties
   TMDB_API_KEY=your_api_key
   ```
3. For release builds with GitHub Actions, add a repository secret named `TMDB_API_KEY`. The build workflow writes it to `secrets.properties`.

### Fixing Gradle Wrapper Issues

If you encounter Gradle wrapper validation errors (especially in CI/CD environments), you can fix them using the provided scripts:

On Unix/Linux/macOS:
```bash
./scripts/fix-gradle-wrapper.sh
```

On Windows:
```cmd
scripts\fix-gradle-wrapper.bat
```

You can also verify the integrity of the Gradle wrapper:

On Unix/Linux/macOS:
```bash
./scripts/verify-gradle-wrapper.sh
```

On Windows:
```cmd
scripts\verify-gradle-wrapper.bat
```

These scripts will regenerate the Gradle wrapper checksums which are required for validation.
